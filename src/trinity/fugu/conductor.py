"""The Conductor policy: propose a workflow for a query.

Two implementations:

* :class:`PromptedConductor` is a ZERO-TRAINING baseline. It asks a chat model
  (any Fireworks pool model, or a dedicated small model) to emit the three-list
  workflow. It establishes the "untrained Fugu-Ultra" reference the GRPO-trained
  Conductor must beat, and it is the cheapest way to exercise the full
  propose -> parse -> execute -> grade pipeline on real models.
* :class:`StubConductor` returns a fixed or callable-provided proposal for
  offline tests (no network).

The trained-LM backend (an HF model fine-tuned by GRPO on the remote H200) plugs
in by implementing the same :class:`Conductor` protocol; see
docs/fugu/REPLICATION_PLAN.md.
