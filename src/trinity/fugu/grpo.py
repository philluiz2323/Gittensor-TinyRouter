"""GRPO for the Conductor: group-normalized advantages, no KL, with cost guards.

This is the open replication of the Conductor's training (arXiv:2512.04388):
GRPO with group size G, advantage = group-normalized reward, and KL beta = 0.
The pieces here are framework-agnostic and offline-testable:

* :func:`group_advantages` is the pure GRPO advantage (mean-subtracted,
  std-normalized within a group). Unit-tested, no I/O.
* :func:`collect_group` does one group's rollouts: it samples G workflows from
  the Conductor, executes them over the pool, scores each with the TWO-STAGE
  training reward, meters the cost, and returns rewards + advantages.
* :func:`train` is the loop skeleton. It drives rollouts and hands each group's
  ``(samples, advantages)`` to a :class:`PolicyBackend`. The backend is where the
  actual gradient step lives; on the remote H200 that is an HF/TRL model, and for
  tests it is a stub. We keep the policy-gradient update behind this seam so the
  loop, the reward, and the cost accounting are all testable with zero GPU.

The reward used for training is :func:`trinity.fugu.reward.training_reward`
(parse-gate + 1.0/0.5). Reporting must use :func:`trinity.fugu.reward.is_correct`
(pure binary). Keeping those apart is how we avoid optimizing a metric that would
read as a false win.
