"""Fugu-Ultra: an open replication of the Conductor (arXiv:2512.04388).

This package adds the *orchestration* half that TinyRouter's TRINITY router
lacks, mirroring OpenFugu (trotsky1997/OpenFugu) but built natively on this
repo's pieces so the grader is the same FIXED, de-bugged grader the rest of the
project uses (``trinity.orchestration.reward``). That reuse is deliberate: it is
how we avoid reintroducing the false positives (prose ``"A"`` read as a choice)
and false negatives (LiveCodeBench reward stuck at 0) that the JOURNAL records
fixing.

Layout (mirrors ``openfugu/`` upstream):

* :mod:`trinity.fugu.workflow`   the natural-language workflow schema, a strict
  parse-gate, and the executor (access-list topology + bounded recursive
  self-call). This is the "Fugu-Ultra" engine.
* :mod:`trinity.fugu.reward`     the two-stage Conductor reward (parse-gate then
  correctness) built ON TOP of the shared grader, plus a PURE-BINARY
  ``is_correct`` used for honest evaluation.
* :mod:`trinity.fugu.conductor`  the policy that proposes a workflow: a prompted
  baseline (zero training) and a stub for offline tests; the trained-LM backend
  is wired on the remote box (see docs/fugu/REPLICATION_PLAN.md).
* :mod:`trinity.fugu.grpo`       framework-agnostic GRPO math (group-normalized
  advantages, no KL) and the rollout/loop skeleton.

The worker pool is the current OpenRouter-backed trio: qwen3.5-35b-a3b,
minimax-m3, and deepseek-v4-flash.
