"""Benchmark adapter registry — the unified seam for the evaluation pipeline.

Importing this package registers the built-in adapters, so a caller only needs::

    from trinity.adapters import get_adapter

    adapter = get_adapter("math500")
    tasks = adapter.load_tasks("test", max_items=100, seed=42)
    score = adapter.score_output(model_output, tasks[0].answer)

The core evaluator resolves a benchmark to an adapter once and then drives the
adapter's interface, so it never branches on the benchmark name. Adding a new
benchmark means implementing :class:`BenchmarkAdapter` and registering it —
nothing in the shared evaluator changes. See :mod:`trinity.adapters.base` for
the interface and :mod:`trinity.adapters.registry` for the lookup.
