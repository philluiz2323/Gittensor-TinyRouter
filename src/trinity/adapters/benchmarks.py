"""Concrete benchmark adapters for the four built-in benchmarks (issue #10).

Each benchmark the repo ships — ``math500``, ``mmlu``, ``gpqa``,
``livecodebench`` — gets its own :class:`~trinity.adapters.base.BenchmarkAdapter`
subclass, replacing the single parametrised ``DelegatingBenchmarkAdapter`` with a
named class per benchmark. The benchmark-specific *loading* logic lives in
:mod:`trinity.adapters.loaders`; the *scoring* stays in
:mod:`trinity.orchestration.reward`. The shared, benchmark-agnostic behaviour
(prompt passthrough, reward delegation, serialization) lives once on
:class:`_BuiltinAdapter`, so nothing is duplicated per benchmark — a subclass only
declares its ``name`` and :class:`~trinity.adapters.base.TaskType`.

These adapters import neither torch nor the dataset module: loading goes through
``loaders.load_split`` (which the back-compat ``dataset.load_tasks`` shim also
calls), so there is no import cycle and both paths share one loading contract.
