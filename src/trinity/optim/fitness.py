"""Fitness evaluation for sep-CMA-ES candidates.

Fitness(θ) = mean binary reward R(τ) over a minibatch of `m_cma` task instances,
each run through the coordination loop with the policy configured by θ.

Concurrency model (see docs/SPEC.md §0.3.7, §5.2):
  - Candidates are evaluated SEQUENTIALLY because SVF mutates the single shared SLM's
    weights in place; two candidates cannot be live on the GPU at once.
  - Within one candidate, the `m_cma` trajectories share θ, so their (fast, serialized)
    SLM forwards interleave while the (slow) Fireworks calls run concurrently.
