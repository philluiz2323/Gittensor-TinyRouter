## 2026-06-23 — Pilot #3 (full_pilot): 12 generations complete, no crashes  #repro #finding

**Result:** First end-to-end training run to **complete all 12 generations** (math500, λ=8, m_cma=8,
3 turns, 64 train tasks) — the timeout-retry + degrade-to-0 fixes held the entire run, zero crashes.

```
gen0 0.094  gen1 0.266  gen2 0.469  gen3 0.500  gen4 0.422  gen5 0.406
gen6 0.297  gen7 0.391  gen8 0.359  gen9 0.469  gen10 0.469  gen11 0.250    (per-gen mean fitness)
```

**Read:** strong early learning (mean 0.094→0.50 over gens 0–3), then the population mean plateaus
and oscillates ~0.25–0.47. `best_fitness` (es.best) = 0.75. `best_theta.npy` saved.

**Caveat (honest):** the cross-generation mean is confounded — common random numbers re-samples a
*different* minibatch each generation, so a harder draw lowers that gen's mean independent of policy
quality (e.g. gen11's 0.250 is likely a hard draw, not regression). So this curve shows "it learned"
but is NOT a clean convergence curve. The decisive measurement is the held-out eval (running now):
TRINITY vs each single model vs random routing on fresh math500 test items (R1/R2/R4).

**Possible next improvements (if eval is inconclusive):** (a) a fixed validation minibatch to make
gen means comparable, (b) larger m_cma to cut reward variance, (c) more generations / σ tuning.

## 2026-06-22 — Pilot #2 (CRN): J climbs, then crashes on httpx.ReadTimeout  #repro #mistake #finding

**Result (the headline so far):** with common random numbers, **sep-CMA-ES learns** — clean upward J:

```
gen0 mean=0.141 best=0.375    gen1 mean=0.203 best=0.375    gen2 mean=0.438 best=0.625
```

Mean fitness tripled and best improved 0.375→0.625 in 3 generations on math500 — the core
replication claim (the trained coordinator improves over evolution) is demonstrated in principle.
`best_theta.npy` + `history.json` saved each generation, so gen-2's θ (fitness 0.625) survived.

**#mistake — run crashed at gen 3 on `httpx.ReadTimeout`.** My Fireworks client retried only on HTTP
status codes (429/5xx), not on network timeouts / transport errors, so one slow reasoning call (>120s)
raised an uncaught `ReadTimeout` that propagated through `asyncio.gather` and killed the whole run.
(The `python | tee` pipeline masked it as exit 0 — `tee` succeeded even though python died.)

**Fixes (#decision):**
1. `FireworksPool.chat` now catches `httpx.TimeoutException`/`TransportError` and retries them
   (transient blips are normal over thousands of calls). Timeout 120→180s, retries 4→6.
2. `evaluate_candidate` uses `gather(return_exceptions=True)` — a trajectory that exhausts retries
   degrades to **reward 0** and logs a warning, instead of crashing the generation/run.
3. Next run uses `nohup` (survives an ssh drop). **Detach gotcha (root-caused):** `nohup cmd > log &`
   inside a long `a && b && read KEY && nohup ... &` chain silently failed because `&` binds the
   *whole* `&&` list — so the chain (including `read KEY`) ran in a backgrounded subshell whose stdin
   is `/dev/null`, the `read` hit EOF, the chain aborted before launching python, and `$!` was just
   the dead subshell. Fix: keep the key-`read` in the foreground and background only the launch with a
   brace group: `... && export KEY && { nohup python ... > log 2>&1 </dev/null & }`. Verified the log
   is created and training proceeds.

**Lesson:** a long API-bound training loop must treat transient network errors as expected, not fatal.
CPU smoke ladder still 4/4 green after the fixes.

## 2026-06-22 — Pilot #1: flat J → root cause = per-candidate minibatch noise → CRN fix  #mistake #finding #decision

**Context:** First real pilot (math500, λ=6, m_cma=4, 12 gens). Ran clean across 5 generations on
GPU 5 (no crashes, per-candidate fitness varied 0.0–1.0), but **mean fitness did not climb**:

```
gen0 mean=0.375  gen1 0.542  gen2 0.375  gen3 0.375  gen4 0.250   (max stuck at 1.0 = lucky minibatch)
```

**Root cause (#mistake in my training loop):** `minibatch_fn(i)` drew a *fresh random* minibatch for
*each candidate* within a generation. With `m_cma=4` the per-candidate fitness is a mean of 4
Bernoulli draws (std ≈ 0.25) AND each candidate saw *different tasks* — so sep-CMA-ES was ranking
candidates largely by task-luck, not policy quality. The "best=1.0" was one candidate that drew 4
easy problems, not a good coordinator. This is precisely the binary-reward variance risk flagged in
SPEC §0.4 and the review (#5).

**Fix / decision (#decision):** **Common Random Numbers (CRN)** — score *all* candidates in a
generation on the *same* minibatch (re-sampled across generations). Standard ES variance-reduction:
fitness *differences* now reflect policy differences, not which tasks were drawn. Also raised
`m_cma 4 → 8` to halve the reward-estimate std. Re-launched as `pilot_crn`. This is a deliberate
[OUR CHOICE] deviation from the paper's "re-sample per replication" phrasing; documented because it
materially changes the optimizer's signal.

**Lesson:** for noisy-reward ES, *how* you sample the fitness minibatch matters as much as the
optimizer. Watch whether `pilot_crn` shows a cleaner upward J trend.

## 2026-06-22 — GPU env up; full smoke ladder S1-S8 PASS; pilot training launched  #repro #finding #gotcha

**Context:** Provisioned the H200 box and ran the GPU/network smoke rungs, then launched training.

**Env:** `uv` venv on the box, **torch 2.12.1+cu130**, transformers 5.12.1, numpy 2.5.0, cma. With
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=5`, `torch.cuda.device_count()==1` (correctly pinned to our H200).

**Smoke ladder (GPU/net rungs) — ALL PASS on GPU 5:**
- **S1**: Qwen3-0.6B loads, `hidden_size=1024`, `layers=28`, encode deterministic, `‖h‖=1.0000`.
- **S2**: SVF `num_scales=7168` — **exactly the predicted 7×1024, confirmed on the real
  checkpoint** (resolves the paper's 9,216 discrepancy for our model). Identity round-trips
  (`max|Δ|=1.2e-3` bf16), perturb changes weights, `reset()` exact.
- **S6**: all 3 Fireworks models answer live with `reasoning_effort=minimal`.
- **S8**: end-to-end fitness produced within the call budget.

**#gotcha — detached launch quoting.** First `nohup`/`setsid` launches failed silently (log file
never created) due to nested single/double-quote + `\$HOME` escaping across the ssh boundary, plus
SIGHUP timing. **Fix:** run training via a local-background `ssh ... | tee` (key fed on stdin →
remote env, never in argv/disk); foreground sanity run first confirmed the loop works
(`gen0 best=0.500`, n=13312, 85s for pop3×m2).

**#finding — uniform-policy argmax degenerates to THINKER.** With `W=0`, argmax over uniform role
logits always picks role index 0 = THINKER (ROLE_ORDER[0]), so a never-trained coordinator under
argmax produces no Worker answer → reward 0. Training uses `sample=True` so it explores; this is
expected, not a bug. Eval uses argmax (post-training, when W is non-trivial).

**Pilot config (running):** math500, λ=8, m_cma=6, T=8, max_items=64, max_turns=3, max_tokens=1024
→ budget ≈ 384 atomic evals. Watching whether `J` rises before committing to a full-budget run.

## 2026-06-22 — Core implemented; CPU smoke rungs green; review bugs fixed  #repro #mistake #finding

**Context:** Implemented all modules (coordinator, roles, orchestration, sep-CMA-ES, train/eval)
via a parallel build + adversarial integration review, then validated the CPU smoke ladder.

**Integration review caught 3 real bugs (fixed before any GPU/LLM spend):**
- **#mistake P0 — LiveCodeBench reward was identically 0.** `reward._run_one_test` read stdin from
  `test["stdin"]` but `dataset.py` emits `{"input":..., "output":...}`, so every code test ran on
  empty stdin → reward 0 for every candidate → CMA would optimize against a dead signal. Fixed to
  read `test.get("stdin", test.get("input",""))` and trigger on `input`/`output` keys.
- **#mistake P1 — `trinity.optim` couldn't import without pycma.** `sep_cmaes.py` re-raised the
  `cma` ImportError at module top. Deferred it into `_import_cma()` (cma is only needed to build
  the optimizer at train time).
- **#mistake P2 — choice-letter extractor matched prose.** `"A nice approach"` → `"A"`. Tightened
  the regexes + restricted the fallback to a final standalone-letter line. Also fixed plain-text
  fraction extraction (`"1/2"` was read as `"2"`).

**Smoke ladder (SPEC §11), CPU rungs run locally — ALL PASS:**
- S3 params pack/unpack round-trip, `n_total=13312`, head `(6,1024)`, `n_svf=7168`.
- S4 multi-turn termination + worker-guarded Verifier-ACCEPT + fail-safe REVISE.
- S5 reward checkers (math incl. fractions, MMLU/GPQA letters, code pass@1 with stdin).
- S7 sep-CMA-ES maximizes a synthetic objective; `popsize(13312)=33` confirmed.

**Follow-up:** provision GPU box env, run GPU rungs S1 (encoder/penultimate), S2 (SVF identity +
real scale count), S6 (live pool), S8 (end-to-end fitness), then launch sep-CMA-ES training on GPU 5.

## 2026-06-22 — Fireworks reasoning-effort mapping resolved  #finding #decision

**Context:** SPEC left "minimal reasoning effort" → API param unspecified (open item #12/#16).
**Finding:** all 3 models accept `reasoning_effort` ∈ {none, low, medium, high} (HTTP 200).
**Decision:** map "minimal" → `reasoning_effort: "low"` in `FireworksPool.chat`; configurable.

## 2026-06-22 — Paper → SPEC, with verified facts & review corrections  #finding #decision #repro

**Context:** Ran a 9-agent deep read of the paper → `docs/SPEC.md` (+ `PAPER_NOTES.md`,
`SPEC_REVIEW.md`). Then grounded the risky numbers against ground truth.

**Findings / corrections (SPEC §0 is authoritative):**
- **Qwen3-0.6B real config:** `hidden_size=1024` (d_h CONFIRMED), **28 layers** (2nd-to-last =
  index 26), GQA (16 q / 8 kv heads, head_dim 128 → `q_proj` is 1024×2048, `o_proj` 2048×1024),
  SwiGLU `intermediate_size=3072`, tied embeddings, bf16. Every linear matrix has min-dim 1024 →
  **1024 SVs each**.
- **SVF count mismatch (#mistake-averted):** paper states 9,216 SVF scales (=9×1024), but a Qwen3
  layer has only **7** linear matrices → 7×1024 = **7,168**. The paper's 9,216 does not map onto
  Qwen3's matrix set. **Decision:** SVF all 7 matrices of layer 26 → 7,168 scales (init 1.0),
  documented delta. Smoke test **S2 must print the real count** and assert θ matches.
- **CMA λ arithmetic error caught by review:** spec body said λ=34; correct is
  `⌈4+3·ln(13312)⌉ = ⌈32.49⌉ = 33`. Budget `B_env = 16·33·60 = 31,680` (body's "34,560" was wrong).
- **Totals (ours):** head `6×1024 = 6,144` + SVF `7,168` = **n = 13,312** trainable (CMA dim).
- **Decisions:** L2-normalize `h` before the head (σ₀ stability); Verifier can't ACCEPT before a
  Worker output exists; MT-Bench is report-only (never binarized into reward); single-model
  baselines run at 20,480 tokens (5×) for fair R1/R2; disk-cache LLM calls.
- **Open risk:** block-ε-separability was shown on the paper's 7-agent pool; it may NOT transfer
  to our 3-model pool, so **R8 (CMA > SFT > RS > REINFORCE) is a hypothesis to test**, not assumed.

**Follow-up:** implement M0–M4, pass the S1–S8 smoke ladder, then run head + sep-CMA-ES on GPU 5.

## 2026-06-22 — Remote H200 box inventory  #finding

**Context:** Inventoried `trinity-gpu` (read-only) before writing the remote setup path.

**Findings:**
- **Ubuntu 24.04**, **192 vCPU**, **~2 TB RAM**. `$HOME` = `/mnt/data/harshal` on a 12 TB array
  with **3.2 TB free** — ample for HF model caches.
- **8× NVIDIA H200 NVL (143 GB each)**, driver `595.71.05`. **We use index 5 only.**
- Python **3.12.3** present; **no `uv`, no `conda`, no `torch`** system-wide → `setup_remote.sh`
  installs `uv` and builds a project `.venv`.
- Network: `huggingface.co` → 200 (model downloads OK). `api.fireworks.ai` root → 404, which is
  expected (the API lives under `/inference/v1`; root has no handler). Not a problem.
- No pre-existing `~/trinity`; we sync there fresh.

**Decision:** default `TRINITY_REMOTE_DIR=$HOME/trinity` (= `/mnt/data/harshal/trinity`),
`HF_HOME` under the project dir to avoid polluting shared `$HOME`.

## 2026-06-22 — Project bootstrap & environment verification  #finding #decision

**Context:** Kicking off the replication. Verified the full toolchain before writing code.

**Findings:**
- **GPU box reachable.** `ssh trinity-gpu` works. `nvidia-smi -i 5` reports **NVIDIA H200 NVL,
  143771 MiB, idle**. We are allocated **GPU 5 only** — all CUDA work pins
  `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=5`.
- **All three Fireworks models answer** a chat completion (HTTP 200):
  `accounts/fireworks/models/deepseek-v4-pro`, `.../glm-5p2`, `.../kimi-k2p6`.
- **GitHub:** authed as `harrrshall` with `repo` scope; repo will be created **private**.

**Decisions:**
- Secrets live **outside the repo**: SSH key at `~/.ssh/trinity_gpu` (600) behind the
  `trinity-gpu` host alias; Fireworks key at `~/.config/trinity/secrets.env` (600), read via
  `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`. `.gitignore` blocks all secret patterns + the 11 MB paper PDF.
- Replication target is the paper's **relative** claims (TRINITY > best single model > random
  routing; sep-CMA-ES > RL/IL/random), since our open-source model pool differs from the
  paper's. See `AGENTS.md` §1.

## 2026-06-22 — Fireworks account model-list endpoint 500s  #gotcha

**Context:** Tried `GET /inference/v1/models` to enumerate available models.
**Actual:** `HTTP 500 — "Error listing deployed models"`.
**Root cause:** That account-level listing endpoint is flaky / not enabled for this key; it is
not needed.
**Fix / decision:** Probe model IDs directly with a tiny `chat/completions` call instead. All
three target IDs returned 200, so we hardcode them in `configs/models.yaml`. Do **not** depend
on the list endpoint.
