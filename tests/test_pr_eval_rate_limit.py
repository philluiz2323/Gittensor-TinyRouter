"""Offline unit tests for the pr_eval rate-limit gate (anti-cheat Gate 1).

These tests exercise ONLY the pure timestamp / rate-limit helpers in
scripts/pr_eval.py. They make NO API calls and need no GPU/network (torch is
imported lazily inside pr_eval, never at module load).

Regression targets:
- Leaderboard timestamps are written in UTC (``time.gmtime`` + trailing ``Z``),
  so they must be read back as UTC. Parsing them with ``time.mktime`` interprets
  the struct as *local* time and skews the epoch by the host's UTC offset,
  silently shifting the 7-day rate-limit window on any non-UTC maintainer box.
- The gate must count *attempts* (every eval that passed Gate 1), not only
  approved wins in ``history``. Otherwise a miner can lose on score and
  immediately resubmit without consuming the weekly slot.
